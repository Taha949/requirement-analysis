# Requirement Analysis: Defining Features and Functionalities

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.  
This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

- **Clarity and Understanding:** Helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.  
- **Scope Definition:** Clearly defines the scope of the project, preventing scope creep.  
- **Basis for Design and Development:** Provides a solid foundation for system design and development.  
- **Cost and Time Estimation:** Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time.  
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensures the final product meets requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### 1. Requirement Gathering üóÇÔ∏è
- **Interviews:** Collecting information from stakeholders.  
- **Surveys/Questionnaires:** Gathering requirements from a larger audience.  
- **Workshops:** Collaborative sessions to refine requirements.  
- **Observation:** Studying end-users in their environment.  
- **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing documentation and systems.  

### 2. Requirement Elicitation ‚úçÔ∏è
- **Brainstorming:** Generating ideas collectively.  
- **Focus Groups:** Engaging selected stakeholders in discussions.  
- **Prototyping:** Creating system prototypes for requirement refinement.  

### 3. Requirement Documentation üìö
- **Requirement Specification Document (RSD):** Detailed list of functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **User Stories:** Functionalities from the user‚Äôs perspective.  
- **Use Cases:** Diagrams showing user-system interactions.  

### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling üìä
- **Requirement Prioritization:** Ranking requirements by importance.  
- **Feasibility Analysis:** Assessing technical, financial, and time constraints.  
- **Modeling:** Using **DFDs**, **ER diagrams**, etc. to visualize requirements.  

### 5. Requirement Validation ‚úÖ
- **Review and Approval:** Stakeholder validation of requirements.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Clear success conditions for requirements.  
- **Traceability:** Ensuring all requirements are covered during development/testing.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements ‚öôÔ∏è
**Definition:** What the system should do.  
**Examples:** Authentication, property search, booking system, registration.  

**Key Functional Requirements:**
- **Search Properties:** Based on location, price, and availability.  
- **User Registration:** Account creation with login credentials.  
- **Property Listings:** Display with details and images.  
- **Booking System:** Book, view, and manage bookings.  
- **User Authentication:** Secure login/registration process.  

---

### Non-functional Requirements üõ°Ô∏è
**Definition:** How the system should perform.  
**Examples:** Performance, security, scalability, usability, reliability.  

**Key Non-functional Requirements:**
- **Performance:** Load pages < 2s, support 1000+ concurrent users.  
- **Security:** Data encryption, secure login, protection against vulnerabilities.  
- **Scalability:** Ability to scale horizontally.  
- **Usability:** Intuitive and user-friendly interface.  
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime, quick recovery from failures.

## Requirement Analysis Process

1. **Requirement Gathering**  
   - Engage with stakeholders (interviews, surveys, workshops).  

2. **Requirement Elicitation**  
   - Refine requirements (brainstorming, prototyping, focus groups).  

3. **Requirement Documentation**  
   - Create RSD, user stories, and use cases.  

4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
   - Prioritize, analyze, and model requirements.  

5. **Requirement Validation**  
   - Review with stakeholders, define acceptance criteria, ensure traceability.

## Use Case Diagrams üìä

**Objective:** Visualize interactions between users and the system.  

**Steps to Create:**
- Identify actors (**guest, registered user, admin**).  
- Define use cases (**search property, book property, manage listings**).  
- Draw interactions between actors and use cases.  

**Benefits:**
- Clear visualization of system functionalities.  
- Helps identify and organize requirements.  
- Improves communication between stakeholders and developers.

## Acceptance Criteria ‚úÖ

**Definition:** Conditions a feature must meet to be accepted.  

**How to Define:**
- Be **specific** and **measurable**.  
- Include **functional** and **non-functional** aspects.  

**Example (Booking System):**  
‚ÄúUsers should be able to select available dates, confirm booking, and receive a confirmation email within 2 minutes.‚Äù  

**Benefits:**
- Clear understanding of requirements.  
- Provides a basis for **testing and validation**.  
- Helps maintain **quality** and **user satisfaction**.

## Putting It All Together üìå

**Steps to Conduct Requirement Analysis:**
1. **Gather Requirements:** Interviews, surveys, document reviews.  
2. **Write User Stories:** Define functionalities collaboratively.  
3. **Define Functional Requirements:** Align with user stories.  
4. **Identify Non-functional Requirements:** Performance, security, scalability.  
5. **Create Use Case Diagrams:** Validate with stakeholders.  
6. **Set Acceptance Criteria:** Ensure clear and measurable success conditions.
